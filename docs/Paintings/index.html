                    <h3 class="yolo">1. "Rozin Mirror"</h3>
                    <p><strong>Due:</strong> Tuesday, 02.04.20, before class</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Create your own screen-based version of a <a href="http://www.smoothware.com/danny/" target="_blank">Daniel Rozin</a>interactive mirror in P5.js, based on the <a href="https://dougrosman.github.io/cvml-saic/code/in_class/day01/01-RozinMirror/">code</a> we wrote in class.</p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>How to submit:</strong> Push your final version to your GitHub, and post the link to the work in the corresponding assignment on Canvas. We will have a quick speed-show at the beginning of class, so arrive with your sketch ready to go! Your link should look something like:<br>
                    <pre>yourgithubusername.github.io/code/in_class/day01/01_RozinMirror</pre>
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Due:</strong>Tuesday, 02.04.20, before class</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>Select a quote from the article that stuck out to you. Write a brief paragraph about why you chose that quote. We will discuss the article in class the day it's due.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to submit:</strong> Write your quote and one-paragraph response in its corresponding Canvas assignment.</p>

                    <h3 class="yolo">1. Text Rain</h3>
                    <p><strong>Due:</strong> Tuesday, 02.11.20, before class</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Recreate the classic<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_u3sSffS78" target="_blank">Text Rain</a>interactive installation created by Camille Utterback and Romy Achituv. Personalize it with your own source text, colors, or other effects; the important thing for this assignment is figuring out how to properly display and manipulate the position of each falling letter. </p>
                    <p>You may attempt it from scratch, but for more in-depth guidelines, as well as some hints/code to get you started, you can use this <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/drosman-cvml/sketches/PHDMlCU8P5.js" target="_blank">P5.js sketch here</a>. If you feel you need more explanation/hints, use this<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/drosman-cvml/sketches/-c0lfB-z" target="_blank">P5.js sketch here</a> (it's the same code, just with more explanatory comments).</p>

                    <p><strong>How to submit:</strong> In the Canvas assignment <a href="https://saic.instructure.com/courses/2645666/assignments/25725799" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
                    <p>Option 1: Post a link to your Text Rain sketch in the p5.js web editor.</p>
                    <p>Option 2: Push your final version to your GitHub, then post a link to your sketch running in the browser.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>NOTE: Even if you haven't completely figured out the "solution" to this assignment, post whatever progress you made, along with some comments in your code with some questions about where you got stuck. That goes for every assignment!</strong></p>

                <h2 class="yolo">Assignment 03</h2>
                    <h3 class="yolo">1. Open-ended CV project</h3>
                    <p><strong>Due:</strong> Tuesday, 02.18.20, before class</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Based on the sketches and techniques we've explored in class, create an interactive P5.js sketch with some computer vision implementation. Use this assignment as an opportunity to experiment with some of the code we've been working with. On Tuesday, we'll have a speed-show at the beginning of class, so please arrive with your sketch ready to run.</p>
                    <p>Your sketch should be viewable in a web page on your personal class website. Additionally, the homepage of your website should have a single image screen-capture of your sketch that works as a link. I fleshed out the sample home page we made in class with some CSS, so it actually looks like a website now (and it's sort of mobile-responsive! Still working on that a bit). You can check that out here: <a href="../sample-portfolio/" target="_blank">Sample Portfolio Site</a>. Check out the about page of that site if you want to use the code to make your own portfolio page. There's also a link to the page in the left-hand menu, at the bottom.</p>

                    <p><strong>How to submit:</strong> Push your changes to your GitHub site, then submit a link to the sketch that lives on your website to Assignment 03 in Canvas.</p>

                <h2 class="yolo">Assignment 04</h2>
                    <h3 class="yolo">1. Creative Coding exercises</h3>
                    <p><strong>Due:</strong> Tuesday, 02.25.20, before class</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Using the creative coding tools we went over in class this week, create the following sketches to the best of your ability. They will start simple and increase in complexity. I'll be adding them throughout the day. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>How to submit:</strong> Push your changes to your GitHub site, then submit a link to an "Assignment 04" page that you create to the Canvas Assignment. That page should have a link to each of the mini-sketches you create for this assignment.</p>
                    <a href="sample.html"><img src="images/sample-page.png" style="width: 300px; border: 2px solid black"></a>

                    <h2 class="yolo">Assignment 05</h2>
                    <h3 class="yolo">1. Mini Midterm</h3>
                    <p><strong>Due:</strong> Tuesday, 03.03.20, beginning of class</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Don't let the word "midterm" stress you out! You only have a week to work on it, I'm not expecting a masterpiece ;). I consider this assignment similar to what we did week three for our open-ended assignment. That said, I'm going to be a little bit pickier about. We'll be presenting these in class next week, and so I'd like you all to put more consideration into how your audience will interact with your work.</p>
                    <p>This work should incorporate Kinect interactivity</p>

                    <ul><strong>Some things to consider...</strong>
                        <li>Will these projected, or should we experience it on your desktop?</li>
                        <li>What lighting conditions does your piece require?</li>
                        <li>How will we know how to interact with it? Can the piece itself communicate how we should interact with it? That could be through on-screen instructions, or maybe it's self-explanatory once you start interacting with it?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Since there's more of a focus on presentation this week, I ask that you come to class prepared with your sketch uploaded to GitHub and ready to show. Part of the requirement for this sketch is showing your work in a web browser, and not just the P5.js online editor</p>

                    
                    <p><strong>How to submit:</strong> Push your changes to your GitHub site, then submit your website link to the Canvas Assignment.</p>
